# Privacy
Textly does NOT collect usage data and therefore does not send it to third party projects. The app only processes the entered text and saves the settings ONLY locally on the device. It only accesses the internet when a button such as the Donation button or the GitHub button is clicked.
The whole project is open source and the code can be viewed 1:1.
